# Fake News Prediction
The focus of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the fake news.Internet is one of the important inventions and a large number of persons are its users. These persons use this for different purposes. There are different social media platforms that are accessible to these users. Any user can make a post or spread the news through these online platforms. These platforms do not verify the users or their posts. So some of the users try to spread fake news through these platforms. These fake news can be a propaganda against an individual, society, organization or political party. A human being is unable to detect all these fake news. So there is a need for machine learning classifiers that can detect these fake news automatically.In this project, we investigate supervised machine learning models to predict the fake news.Different models like  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,Gradient Boost Classifier and Random Forest Classifier have been used to make the predictions. The predictions are then compared in order to find those which provide the best performances.All four methods provided comparable performance. The number of different attributes is measured, and also it has been considered to predict a more reliable and accurate result.We also compared the prediction accuracy of these models to determine the best one.Our results show that the Logistic Regressioin Model yields the best results.

Fake news detection using machine learning algorithms is a promising approach to combating fake news. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets and identify patterns that are commonly found in fake news articles. By detecting fake news articles before they are widely disseminated, machine learning algorithms can prevent the harm caused by fake news.It is important to use diverse datasets and other techniques, such as fact-checking, to verify the authenticity of news articles.utilizing machine learning algorithms for fake news detection shows promise due to their ability to analyze large datasets and identify patterns commonly associated with fake news. However, it is crucial to ensure diverse training datasets and employ complementary techniques, like fact-checking, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the detection process. Combining these approaches can help in the ongoing battle against fake news and contribute to a more informed society.
